<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Engineering Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting Type</li><li>Thermoplastics Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automotive Engineering Plastics market is broadly categorized into thermosetting and thermoplastics types. Thermosetting plastics, once cured, become rigid and do not soften upon heating, making them suitable for high-temperature applications and structural components. In contrast, thermoplastics remain pliable when heated, allowing for easy molding and recycling, which is ideal for parts like dashboards and interior trims. Both types offer lightweight, corrosion-resistant solutions that enhance vehicle performance and fuel efficiency, driving their demand in the automotive industry.</p></p>
